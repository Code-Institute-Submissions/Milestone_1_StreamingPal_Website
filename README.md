![StreamingPal](/assets/images/logo.png)

StreamingPal is a website that help the user to decide what to watch on streaming 
from Netflix, Prime Video or Disney+ in short time by providing them with only the information they really need for their choice.

You can visit the website by clicking [here](https://fral96.github.io/Milestone_1_StreamingPal_Website/).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1. UX

### 1.1 Project goals

Streaming pal is a consultancy website that people can use to plan their movie night and get ideas on what to watch.

Many people, like me, love watching tv series and movies, when planning to do so, spend several minutes browsing through the titles on
their streaming platform, then going online to read review and maybe, after a few minutes of watching the chosen one,
they realize is actually boring. This website was created for them.

StreamingPal's goal is to reduce drastically this waste of time.

The website includes a presentation of myself, so that people can relate (or not), to the kind of tv series and movies I prefer.

It also includes a carousel of movies and tv series of the three main streaming platform (Netflix, Prime Video and Disney+),
and clicking on them, the user will find just a few information to make him/her understand when and where to watch it and if it is worthy or not.
