----------------------

![StreamingPal](/assets/images/logo.png)

StreamingPal is a website that helps the user to decide what to watch on streaming 
from Netflix, Prime Video or Disney+ in short time by providing them with only the information they really need for their choice.

You can visit the website by clicking [here](https://fral96.github.io/Milestone_1_StreamingPal_Website/).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1. UX

### 1.1 Project goals

Streaming pal is a consultancy website that people can use to plan their movie night and get ideas on what to watch.

Many people, like me, love watching tv series and movies and when planning to do so, spend several minutes browsing through the titles on
their streaming platform, then going online to read the reviews and maybe, after a few minutes of watching the chosen one,
they realize is actually boring. This website was created for them.

StreamingPal's goal is to reduce drastically this waste of time.

The website includes a presentation of myself, so that people can relate (or not), to the kind of tv series and movies I prefer.

It also includes a carousel of movies and tv series of the three main streaming platform (Netflix, Prime Video and Disney+),
and clicking on them, the user will find just a few information to make him/her understand when and where to watch it and if it is worthy or not.

![HTML](//readme/HTMLvalidator.png)

I decided to keep the line noted as warning as helped me to control better the responsiveness of the website.


To verify my CSS code I used [W3C](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/):

The CSS code came out without errors:

-------------------------------------------------------------

#### Responsiveness

The tools used to test the responsiveness are [DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) and [Responsive-Design-Checker](https://www.responsivedesignchecker.com/).

Here below the devices the website is been tested on and returned positive results:

Mobile | Tablet | Desktop

* As a moderator, I love tv series and movies and I want to share my opinions with others.
* As a moderator, I want to become one of the most user friendly and reliable website on the topic, so that I will attract more visitors and gain popularity.

On my website I shared a carousel of movies and tv series that I seen and I reviewed them by providing my opinion and a few extra information as when and with who to watch it, besides some general information like year, genere and plot.

The users, once on the homepage, will just have to click on the streaming platform they have and select the tv series or movie they are interested in in order to read the information.

I set a gif as homepage background in order to give the WOW effect to everybody visiting the website and invite them to look more into.

I also added some (fictional) reviews to make users understand that many people have a positive opinion about StreamingPal.

In the footer, users can find the socials where I have an account with my website: Facebook, Instagram, Youtube and Twitter.

* As a moderator, I want to inform the user a bit about me, so that he/she could understand my vision and my taste about movies/tv series.
* As a user, I want to know more about the moderator so that I can relate or not to her reviews.

The users can click on the About me tab to see my photo and read some information about me and why I created the website.

Besides, they will also find a list of movies and tv series generes that I like and the ones I dislike.

#### Netflix/Prime video/Disney+

* As a moderator, I want users to be able to locate movies and tv series based on the streaming platform they have, so that it will not create confusion or disappointment for finding an interesting movie/tv series that is on a platform they do not have.
* As a user, if, for example, I have a Netflix subscription, I want to click on the Netflix tab so that I can see reviews about only the movies/tv series that I can find on Netflix.

Once on the homepage, the users can select the streaming platform where they desire to watch the tv series or movie; the choice is between Netflix, Prime video and Disney+.

In the modal the users will see when selecting a movie they will find a really short plot and my opinion. The text is written in a fun and brief way so the users could decide in just a few minutes what is the movie or tv serie that will suit them better. 

#### Inspire me

* As a moderator, I want people to advise me about movies/tv series that they think are cool and deserve to be reviewed, so that I can keep my website always updated and full of titles.

From the homepage, the users can click on the Inspire me tab. In that section they will find a little form that they can fill if they just seen a tv series of movie that they really enjoy and that is still not on the website.
The form requires a name, email address, streaming platform and a few information about it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Bugs

* One of the bugs I found is the menu that, when displayed on smaller devices, wasn't easily accessible.
I solved this problem by creating a hamburger menu that activates only on devices that are too small to display the normal one.

* Another bug I found was that when you are in the section Netflix, Prime Video or Disney+ and click on one of the arrows of the carousels, the page scrolls completely up.
I couldn't find what provoke this bug so I decided to contact the tutor team to ask for suggestions. In their opinion this could be stopped just by using JQuery and JavaScript, however, at the moment I have no knowledge about those programs so I decided to not use them.
When I will acquire those knowledges I will go back and try solve this problem.

* Another problem I had is that to create the previews for the movies I created too many HTML files (one per movie).
I solved this by writing the information about movies and tv series in modals that appear when a movie is clicked.
